This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

# RCFA AI Demo

An AI-powered Root Cause Failure Analysis tool that helps analyze equipment failures and generate actionable insights.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
# OpenAI API Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.2

# Authentication (Server-side only - NOT exposed to browser)
APP_PASSWORD=your-access-password-here
AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=random-secret-string-for-token-signing

# App Configuration (Client-visible)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=dev
```

**Security Note:** The authentication system uses server-side password verification with signed tokens stored in httpOnly cookies. Never use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for sensitive values like passwords or secrets.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
